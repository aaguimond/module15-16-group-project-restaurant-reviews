## Purpose

To provide foodies with a forum to find and review restaurants, and to test our capabilities as developers.

## Installation

This project is being hosted live on Render temporarily. To test the application locally, simply download the repo, run "npm install" in a terminal from the repo, initiate your psql database, and run "npm run" from the terminal. Please be mindful of the environmental variables you choose.

## Usage

Users for this application can register an account with a username, email, and password. Their passwords are encrypted prior to being saved in the database with their user information. After logging in, a user can search any restaurant they choose to view photos and details about the restaurant (like address, phone number, and hours of operation). Users can also view reviews other users have left on restaurants and leave reviews of their own.
